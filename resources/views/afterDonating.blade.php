      <p>
        
            <h4>After donating you sit in an observation area, where you rest and eat a light snack. After 15 minutes, you can leave. After your blood donation:
            </h4><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink extra fluids for the next day or two,  but avoid caffeine.</li>
                <li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for the next five hours.</li>
                <li>If you feel lightheaded, lie down with your feet up until the feeling passes.</li>
                <li>You can go to work immediately after donating blood, doctors advise avoidance of intense physical exertion.</li>
                <li>Soon after, make sure you drink a fruit juice or glucose-rich drink and eat a light snack like fruits.</li>
                <li>Avoid smoking.</li>
                <li>Keep the bandage on your arm and dry for five hours.</li>
                <li>If you have bleeding after removing the bandage, put pressure on the site and raise your arm until the bleeding stops.</li>
                <li>If bleeding or bruising occurs under the skin, apply a cold pack to the area periodically during the first 24 hours.</li>
                
            </ul>
            Contact the blood donor centre or your doctor if you forgot to report any important health information before you donated or if you had any problems or needed medical care after giving blood.
            <br> <br> <br><br>
            <h4>You should also call the centre if you:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue to feel nauseated, lightheaded or dizzy after resting, eating and drinking.</li>
                <li>Notice a raised bump, continued bleeding or pain at the needle-stick site when you remove the bandage.</li>
                <li>Feel pain or tingling down your arm, into your fingers.</li>
                <li>Become ill with signs and symptoms of a cold or flu, such as fever, headache or sore throat, within four days after your blood donation. Bacterial infections can be transmitted by your blood to another person via transfusion, so it's important to let the blood donor centre know if you become ill so that your blood won't be used.
                </li>
            </ul>
