      <p>
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Vegetarian cannot donate blood as their blood doesnâ€™t contain enough iron. <br> <br>

        <h4>Fact :</h4> Vegetarians can donate blood too. The iron needed is taken from body stores and once a balanced diet is maintained is replaced after donation. This usually normally takes a month or so.
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Myth :</h4>Donating blood is painful. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4>The pain experienced is no more than a needle prick. The slight soreness that maybe where the needle was is just a reminder of the good deed done.
        
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Fact :</h4>A clear procedure exists for taking blood from each donor. Sterility is maintained at all steps. A sterile, new needle is used for each donation and is then properly discarded. Use of sterile equipment and technique limits the chance of infection.
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Blood donation is a very time consuming act. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4> The time taken for a single donation session is normally not more than an hour or so.<br> <br>

        <h4>Fact :</h4> Only about 350-450ml of blood is taken during a donation session. There is enough blood in the body to donate it without any ill effects. The body makes new blood after donation in a span of 3 months
        
        <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Overweight people have more blood in them. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4> Overweight people are less healthy, so they do not have more blood. <br> <br>
        
        
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Health deterioration takes place after blood donation. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4> If you are healthy prior to donation, your recovery is complete in a day or two. It is advised to rest a while after donating. Drinking enough liquids replaces the lost fluid within a couple of hours. The body produces new cells faster after a donation. All the RBCs are replaced within 3-4 days and WBCs within 3 weeks.

        <h4>Myth :</h4> People on medication cannot donate blood. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4> Depending on the medication being taken, it may halt donation for a period, though in many cases it won't prevent a donation. Person in charge or the nursing staff should be informed before donating.
        <br> <br>
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Human blood can be manufactured.<br> <br>

        <h4>Myth :</h4> People of  mixed race have inferior blood quality. <br> <br>
        
        <h4>Fact :</h4> Race and caste have no bearing on eligibility being a blood donor. It is the blood type and group that is of importance. <br> <br>
        
        
        <h4>Myth :</h4> Blood donation can tell if one is HIV positive. <br> <br>
