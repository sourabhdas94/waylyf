                    Donating blood regularly is beneficial to prevent and reduce heart attacks and liver diseases. 

                    The risk of heart and the liver-related problem is caused by the iron overload in the body. Donating blood helps in maintaining the iron level in the body and thus reduce those risk.

                    Blood storage. <br>

                    There is no other method to manufacture blood. The only way to collect blood is from the people who are willing to donate. The blood that we donate is also stored at the blood bank after their usage and used in future when needed. Some chemicals are added to it in order to preserve it for a long time and use it in future when needed.
